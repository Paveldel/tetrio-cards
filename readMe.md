# Tetr.io cards

recently I felt inspired by the quick play modification cards in [tetr.io](https://tetr.io/) and decided I wanted to try recreating it.

the site is made out of simple html/css/js and should be really easy test out.

The tarot card were made by **deliriumt** which you can find [here](https://deliriumt.itch.io/cat-tarot-cards?download), I thought they were really good and a little silly.
